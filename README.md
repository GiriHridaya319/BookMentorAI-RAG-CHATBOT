Got it! Here’s a simplified README tailored for your current state (just the notebook in a folder named `CHATBOT`):

# CHATBOT — RAG-based Document Query Chatbot with Llama 3.2

This repository contains a single Jupyter notebook implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions based on uploaded documents. The chatbot uses hybrid retrieval (vector search + BM25), cross-encoder reranking, and Llama 3.2 via Ollama for generation.

## Features

* Combines vector and BM25 retrieval for relevant document search
* Re-ranks results using a cross-encoder for better accuracy
* Generates answers with Llama 3.2 based on retrieved context
* Maintains conversational history for multi-turn Q\&A

## Project Structure

```
CHATBOT/
└── chatbot.ipynb   # Jupyter notebook with full implementation
```

## Setup & Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install dependencies (e.g., langchain, ollama, etc.).
3. Install Ollama and download Llama 3.2:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ollama pull llama3
   ```
4. Open `chatbot.ipynb` and run the notebook cells to start interacting with the chatbot.

## Notes

* This is a prototype focused on experimentation and learning.
* Future versions will include a dedicated UI and modular code structure.
